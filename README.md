# Mirror a text area

We have been using text areas in many web applications. However, there are many limitations when working with text area. For example, it only accept raw text value. This can be a hindrance when trying to implement advanced features such as highlighting a keyword, displaying the line numbers.

This series introduces a technique to mirror a text area element. Instead of working with the text area element directly, we create a copied element that look identical with the original text area. It's also placed at the same position as the text area. By doing this, we can enhance the user experience by allowing users to interact with the mirrored element in ways that were not possible with the original text area.
